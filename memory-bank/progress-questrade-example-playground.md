# Questrade Example Functional Playground - AI Agent Update Log

## [2025-07-29T00:00:00Z] Functional Refactor Initiated

- Modularization plan created and documented in `planification-agent/questrade-example-functional-refactor.plan.md`.
- All configuration and output centralized as constants in `src/example.ts`.
- All logic split into pure, composable functions.
- Output unified to `.keys/example-sdk-demo.json` only.
- Labeled as intermediate refactor phase for future modularization.

## [2025-07-29T00:10:00Z] Memory Bank Protocol Activated

- AI agent instructed to update all related `.prompt.md` and `.instructions.md` files to reference this playground as the canonical example for isolated feature prototyping.
- README files to be updated to reflect new approach.
- All changes and rationale to be logged in memory-bank/ for agent autonomy.
