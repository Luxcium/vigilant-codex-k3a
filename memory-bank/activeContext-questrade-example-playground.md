# Questrade Example Functional Playground Context

## Purpose

This file documents the current state and intent of the `src/example.ts` file as a functional playground for AI agent and user collaboration. It is used to develop, test, and modularize authentication and account-fetching features in isolation before integrating them into the SDK or production codebase.

## Current State

- All configuration and output are centralized at the top of the file as constants.
- All logic is split into pure, composable functions.
- Only `.keys/example-sdk-demo.json` is written for output; no split or duplicate files.
- The file is labeled as an intermediate refactor phase, preparing for future dependency injection and SDK integration.

## AI Agent Guidance

- Use this file as a safe playground for iterative feature development and refactoring.
- Do not explain standard TypeScript, Node.js, or Questrade API details in memory bank documentationâ€”focus on project-specific context and agent behaviors.
- When updating related `.prompt.md` or `.instructions.md` files, reference this playground as the canonical example for isolated feature prototyping.
- Document all changes and rationale in memory-bank/ as you proceed.

## Next Steps

- Review and update all related `.prompt.md` and `.instructions.md` files to reference this playground context.
- Update relevant README files to reflect the new modular, functional approach.
- Continue to log all context and changes in memory-bank/ for agent autonomy and future reference.

This file is for AI agent and user collaboration only. It is not intended for production use or detailed human documentation outside the agent context.
