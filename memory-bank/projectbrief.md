# projectbrief.md
STATUS: ðŸŸ¢ Active

## Purpose
This file is the foundation of the Memory Bank. It defines the core requirements, goals, and scope for any project. It is the primary source of truth for all subsequent documentation and must be maintained with precision.

## Structure
- **Purpose:** Why this Memory Bank exists.
- **Scope:** What is included and excluded.
- **Core Requirements:** High-level objectives and constraints.
- **Call to Action:** Instructions for agents to update and self-regulate this file.

---

## Purpose

This Memory Bank is initialized to provide a replicable, self-explanatory documentation structure for any project. It is designed for use by multiple AI agents and human collaborators, ensuring clarity, consistency, and ease of onboarding.

## Scope

- Covers all stages of project documentation, from inception to completion.
- Excludes any project-specific details at this stage.
- Must be updated as soon as a project topic or context is defined.

## Core Requirements

- Maintain clarity and completeness at all times.
- Ensure all documentation is up-to-date and reflects the current state of the project.
- Facilitate seamless collaboration between agents and contributors.
- **All setup and file/folder creation must be performed via scripts in the `scripts/` directory, never manually.**
- **Scripts must be idempotent, must not overwrite existing files, and must warn or skip if files/folders exist.**
- **All rules and intentions must be documented in the README before implementation.**
- **The README and all scripts must remain markdown-lint strict mode compliant at all times.**

## Dependencies and Relationships

- **Depends On:** _[List upstream dependencies, e.g., productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, etc.]_
- **Required By:** _[List downstream dependencies, e.g., all other Memory Bank files]_
- **Why This Order:** _[Explain why projectbrief.md is foundational for other documentation]_
- **Impact Analysis:** _[Describe what happens if this file is not kept up to date or if dependencies change]_

## Call to Action

> **All agents and contributors must review, update, and self-regulate this file as the project evolves.**  
> **Do not proceed with project-specific work until this file is reviewed and aligned with the current project context.**  
> **Update this file immediately upon any change in project scope or requirements.**

## AI Agent Instructions

This project supports three AI agents with specific entry points:
- **Cline AI** â†’ `.clinerules/main-rules.md` (Cline AI's primary instruction file)
- **Codex CLI** â†’ `AGENTS.md` (Codex CLI's primary instruction file)
- **VS Code Copilot** â†’ `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (VS Code Copilot's primary instruction file)

**See [.clinerules/reading-protocol.md](../.clinerules/reading-protocol.md), [.clinerules/writing-protocol.md](../.clinerules/writing-protocol.md), and [.clinerules/verification.md](../.clinerules/verification.md) for required protocols.**
