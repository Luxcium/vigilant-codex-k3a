# The `systemPatterns.md` Memory Bank File

Your AI Agent will actively strive to keep this file up to date with the latest system patterns, including architectural patterns, design patterns, and component relationships. This file MUST be updated by any AI Agent eagerly each time it will make changes on each chat completion and each task or subtask as the authoritative guide for all system architecture aspects of the Vigilant Codex K3a polyvalent AI development workspace.

## Purpose

This file documents the system architecture, key technical decisions, design patterns, and component relationships for the Vigilant Codex K3a polyvalent AI development workspace. It serves as a living reference for how the system is structured and how its parts interact, providing the architectural foundation for all development decisions.

## Structure

- **Architecture Overview** - Project organization and structural principles
- **Key Technical Decisions** - Rationale for major architectural choices
- **Design Patterns** - Established patterns and conventions
- **Component Relationships** - How system parts interact and depend on each other
- **Dependencies and Relationships** - File relationships and impact analysis
- **Call to Action** - Instructions for maintaining this file

## Architecture Overview

### Project Root Code Organization Standard

The Vigilant Codex K3a follows a polyvalent architecture organized by language and framework at the project root to ensure clarity, modularity, and scalability across multiple technologies:

### Polyvalent Directory Structure

```text
... (directory tree omitted here for brevity; see active version for authoritative reference)
```

### Root Context Classification

(Directory root-context table repeated here – now centralized in root-contexts.md)

### Architectural Principles

- **Language Separation** ...
- **Framework Coexistence** ...
- **Script-Driven Setup** ...
- **AI Agent Integration** ...
- **Conditional Environments** ...

### Multi-Language Support Strategy
(Details for TS, Next.js, Python, Jupyter, Docker)

## Key Technical Decisions
(Native Fetch API Modernization ✅, Three AI Agent Ecosystem Architecture ✅,
Conditional Environment Framework ✅, Codex Universal Docker Environment ✅,
Memory Bank System Optimization ✅, Next.js v15+ Server Actions Implementation ✅)

## Design Patterns
(AI Agent Collaboration Patterns, Container Orchestration Patterns,
Script Architecture & Maintenance Principles, Consolidation History,
Automation Protocols, Next.js Component Architecture, Testing Architecture,
Edge DevTools, Conditional Framework Pattern)

## Component Relationships
(Memory Bank hierarchy diagram, AI coordination flow, technology integration relationships)

## Dependencies and Relationships
(Depends / Required By / Impact)

## Call to Action
(Maintenance directives)

## AI Agent Instructions
