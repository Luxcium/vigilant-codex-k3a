# activeContext-archive-2025-07-18-2025-11-08.md

## Purpose
Complete historical preservation of all verbose activeContext.md entries (work focus logs, decisions, notes) prior to November 8 2025 condensation. Enables aggressive pruning of the live activeContext.md for rapid AI ingestion without loss of provenance.

## Archived Original Content (Verbatim)

```
[BEGIN ORIGINAL activeContext.md CONTENT]

- [2025-08-09T06:04:52+00:00] Prompt metadata standardized
  **Current State:** All prompt files now use front matter with description and tools fields, and all `mode:` lines were removed.
  **Last Action:** Added missing front matter and removed deprecated `mode` lines across memory-bank/prompts.
  **Rationale:** Ensure consistent metadata and align prompts with current project standards.
  **Next Intent:** Monitor future prompt additions for compliance.
  **Meta:** I am updating my self-documentation after standardizing prompt metadata. This entry reaffirms that all actions and context changes MUST be documented and that this rule itself is part of the ongoing protocol.

- [2025-08-11T19:44:17Z] Session initialization and full Memory Bank sync
  **Current State:** All core Memory Bank files read this session (projectbrief.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, activeContext.md, progress.md, dependencies.md). No code changes performed; context fully hydrated.
  **Last Action:** Retrieved current timestamp via approved script `scripts/get_current_datetime.sh` and completed reading remaining files (progress.md, dependencies.md) to finish sync.
  **Rationale:** Mandatory CRITICAL MEMORY BANK PROTOCOL requirement to load entire Memory Bank at session start for stateful continuity and to prevent context drift before any implementation tasks.
  **Next Intent:** Await user task instructions; once received, create/refresh todo list, then proceed with planned actions (e.g., potential script consolidation follow-ups or instruction standardization) while maintaining self-documentation.
  **Meta:** Executing Self-Documentation Protocol at session start. This entry reaffirms that all actions and context changes MUST be documented and that this rule itself is part of the ongoing protocol.

- [2025-08-09T06:03:14+00:00] Chatmode front matter simplified
  **Current State:**
  All chatmode files now have only `description` and an empty `tools` array in their front matter, removing explicit `model` declarations.
  **Last Action:**
  Removed model lines and cleared tools arrays in `plan`, `vscode-helper`, `setup-context`, `proto-notebook`, `questrade-sdk-developer`, and `tsdoc-typedoc` chatmodes.
  **Rationale:**
  Standardizes chatmode configuration and prevents hardcoded model references.
  **Next Intent:**
  Monitor chatmode files for consistency with evolving project standards.
  **Meta:**
  Self-documentation after simplifying chatmode front matter.
- [2025-08-09T06:00:07Z] VS Code placeholder tasks defined
  **Current State:**
  `.vscode/tasks.json` now defines shell tasks for project-status, lint, test, and build.
  **Last Action:**
  Replaced the empty tasks array with placeholder echo commands for initialisation.
  **Rationale:**
  Provide baseline VS Code tasks to guide future automation workflows.
  **Next Intent:**
  Update these tasks with real commands once tooling is ready.
  **Meta:**
  Self-documentation after adding editor tasks to support future workflow automation.
- [2025-08-03T22:55:00Z] Created and referenced 'Get Current Date/Time' task for timestamping
  **Current State:**
  A dedicated task for obtaining the current date/time in ISO 8601 format has been defined in `scripts/README.md`. All instructions now reference this task instead of the raw `date --iso-8601=seconds` command. The self-documentation and instruction-authoring standards have been updated accordingly.
  **Last Action:**
  Added the task definition to `scripts/README.md`, updated `self-documentation.instructions.md` to reference the task, and added a new section to `instruction-authoring-standards.instructions.md` for timestamping best practices.
  **Rationale:**
  To ensure discoverability, maintainability, and protocol compliance for all timestamping and logging actions, and to avoid direct use of raw shell commands in documentation.
  **Next Intent:**
  Monitor for any future direct uses of `date` and enforce exclusive use of the task. Continue to update documentation and protocols as needed.
  **Meta:**
  I am updating my self-documentation after creating and referencing the 'Get Current Date/Time' task. This entry reaffirms that all actions and context changes MUST be documented and that this rule itself is part of the ongoing protocol.
  **Current State:**
  The canonical playground `src/example.ts` was hardened to include HTTP status codes in the output file `.keys/example-sdk-demo.json` on error. The playground was built and executed, and the output file was verified to contain the correct status code (400) on failure. This confirms robust error reporting and output verification as part of the recursive demonstration workflow.
  **Last Action:**
  Patched `example.ts` to propagate and record HTTP status codes on error, rebuilt and ran the playground, and verified `.keys/example-sdk-demo.json` for correct error code output.
  **Rationale:**
  To fulfill the requirement for robust, agentic, and reproducible playground development, ensuring all error outputs include HTTP status codes for better debugging and agent memory.
  **Next Intent:**
  Continue recursive, output-verified workflow for all future playground iterations and maintain robust error reporting.
  **Meta:**
  I am updating my self-documentation after verifying output and HTTP error code inclusion. This entry reaffirms that all actions and context changes MUST be documented and that this rule itself is part of the ongoing protocol.

## Metadata
- **Archive Range:** 2025-07-18 → 2025-11-08
- **Source File:** activeContext.md (pre-condensation)
- **Integrity:** Verbatim preservation (including duplicates and legacy formatting) to ensure zero knowledge loss.

## Call to Action
> Do not modify historical sections except to append future dated archival snapshots. All new active context entries belong in the live `activeContext.md` after condensation. Use this archive to recover rationale removed from the active file.
