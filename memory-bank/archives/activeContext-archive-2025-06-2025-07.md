## Historical Context Archive

### [2025-07-18T15:54:00Z] Next.js v15+ Server Actions - Production Ready Application ✅

**Current Status**: ✅ **FULLY OPERATIONAL** - Next.js v15+ application running at http://localhost:3000 with properly functioning Server Actions and database integration.

**Critical Fixes Applied**:

- ✅ **Missing revalidatePath** - Added `revalidatePath('/')` to both `createPost` and `likePost` Server Actions
- ✅ **Database Schema Sync** - Updated Prisma schema with User model and proper relations
- ✅ **Database Reset** - Applied fresh schema with `--force-reset` to resolve migration conflicts
- ✅ **Environment Reactivation** - PostgreSQL database and Next.js dev server fully operational
- ✅ **Form Validation** - Added proper validation to prevent empty posts

**Resolved User Issue**: The user's post creation was working but posts weren't appearing due to missing cache revalidation. This is now fixed - new posts will immediately appear after creation.

### [2025-07-14T07:00:00Z] Microsoft Edge DevTools Integration and CSS Variables Solution ✅

Successfully completed comprehensive Edge DevTools debugging configuration with protocol compliance restoration. Implemented CSS variables solution for no-inline-styles warning resolution using `style={{ '--dynamic-color': value }}` pattern with CSS classes containing `var(--custom-property, fallback)`.

### [2025-07-13T11:08:00Z] README Drift Resolution ✅

Systematically resolved documentation drift between .github/instructions/README.md, .github/prompts/README.md, and main README.md through comprehensive analysis of 26 instruction files and 27 prompt files. All documentation now accurately reflects workspace sophistication.

### [2025-07-20T01:15:00Z] Native Fetch API Conversion ✅

Successfully converted entire Questrade SDK codebase from node-fetch to native fetch API, maintaining 259 passing tests and TypeScript compilation. All HTTP client operations now use Node.js 22 native fetch for improved performance and reduced dependencies.

### [2025-07-06T19:13:17Z] Test Suite Optimization and Coverage Achievement ✅

Successfully resolved all test failures and achieved 98.34% branch coverage for the TypeScript SDK test suite. All 259 tests now pass with comprehensive mocking strategies and edge case handling.

### [2025-10-07T20:05:00Z] GitHub MCP Server Integration ✅

**Last Action**: Completed full installation following MCP server installation rules.

**Technical Achievements**:

1. Created /home/luxcium/Documents/Cline/MCP/github-mcp-server directory
2. Verified Docker availability and pulled ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server image
3. Obtained GitHub Personal Access Token with proper permissions
4. Added server configuration to cline_mcp_settings.json
5. Demonstrated capabilities using get_me and search_repositories tools

**Rationale**: Enable comprehensive GitHub automation and interaction capabilities through official GitHub MCP server.

## Active Decisions Archive

### Standardized Project Root Organization

- **Decision**: Adopted and documented organization by language and framework
- **Implementation**: `src/` for TypeScript, `web/` for Next.js, `python/` for Python, `scripts/` for automation
- **Rationale**: Clear separation of concerns and multi-language support

### Script-Only File Creation

- **Decision**: All setup and file/folder creation must be performed via scripts in scripts/ directory, never manually
- **Implementation**: Comprehensive script system with idempotency checks
- **Rationale**: Ensures reproducible and documentable setup processes

### Conditional Framework Standard

- **Decision**: Instruction files must use parameter-driven conditional sections rather than hard-coded implementation choices
- **Implementation**: ENV_MODE parameter system for runtime decision deferral
- **Rationale**: Maximum flexibility without rebuilding project structure

### Memory Bank Protocol

- **Decision**: All AI agents must read memory bank at session start and update after significant changes
- **Implementation**: Mandatory reading protocol with self-documentation requirements
- **Rationale**: Maintains context across sessions and prevents information loss

### No Lock Files Policy

- **Decision**: Package manager lock files will not be generated or committed until further notice
- **Implementation**: .gitignore entries and script configurations to prevent lock file creation
- **Rationale**: Avoid version conflicts during active development phase
