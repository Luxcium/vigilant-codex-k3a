## What Works

### [2025-07-23] Root Context Documentation & Script Protocol ✅

**Achievement:**
Established full root context classification across top-level folders and automated script documentation requirements.

**Details:**

- Updated README.md and memory bank with comprehensive folder list
- Added rule to keep `scripts/README.md` in sync with script updates
- Ensured every script documents its purpose and decision rationale

**Impact:**
Streamlines onboarding and keeps maintenance autonomous for all AI agents.

### [2025-07-23] Root Context & Script Documentation Protocol ✅

**Achievement:**
Completed inventory of all top-level folders with explicit root context
classification. Updated `README.md` and `systemPatterns.md` accordingly and
added autonomous script documentation requirements.

**Impact:**
Ensures consistent folder structure awareness and keeps script documentation in
sync without manual prompts.

### [2025-07-21] Web Development Environment Inventory & Documentation ✅

**Achievement:**
Completed a full inventory and explanation of all scripts, tasks, and configuration relevant to live web development in the `web/` directory. Mapped the chain of custody for launching and running the Next.js dev server (port 3000), explained all integration points (scripts, tasks, browser preview, error monitoring), and updated documentation in `web/README.md`.

**Details:**
- Documented all web/dev scripts in `scripts/` (activation, setup, error monitoring, Docker)
- Explained VS Code tasks and launch configs for web development
- Reviewed root and `web/` `package.json` scripts and aliases
- Mapped the chain of custody for live dev (from script/task to browser preview)
- Updated `web/README.md` with a detailed section on live dev workflow and chain of custody
- Ensured all findings are cross-referenced and commented

**Impact:**
Provides a clear, actionable, and fully documented workflow for live web development, supporting onboarding, troubleshooting, and AI agent collaboration. Fulfills the user's request for a methodical, scrupulous, and cumulative explanation and documentation of the web development environment.

**Meta:**
This entry is part of the Self-Documentation Protocol. All actions and context changes are documented and this rule itself is part of the ongoing protocol.

### [2025-07-23] Root Context Classification & Script Protocol ✅

**Achievement:**
Defined official root contexts and established a mandatory script documentation policy.
Created `memory-bank/root-contexts.md` and synchronized updates to `README.md`, `.clinerules/main-rules.md`, and `scripts/README.md`.

**Impact:**
Provides clear folder purpose definitions and ensures scripts remain well-documented and consolidated across the project.

**Meta:**
Self-Documentation Protocol executed after adding root context classification and script maintenance rules.

### Next.js v15+ Server Actions Application ✅

**Status:** ✅ **FULLY OPERATIONAL** - Production-ready Next.js v15+ application running at http://localhost:3000

**Current Capabilities:**

- ✅ **Server Actions** - Form submissions with `'use server'` and immediate UI updates

- ✅ **Real-time Updates** - Cache revalidation with `revalidatePath()` after mutations
- ✅ **Client Components** - Interactive like buttons with optimistic updates
- ✅ **Server Components** - Efficient data fetching and rendering
- ✅ **Form Validation** - Proper validation preventing empty posts

**Technical Implementation:**

```typescript
'use server';
import { prisma } from '@/lib/prisma';
import { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache';

export async function createPost(formData: FormData) {
  const title = formData.get('title') as string;
  const content = formData.get('content') as string;

  if (!title || !content) {
    throw new Error('Title and content are required');
  }

  await prisma.post.create({ data: { title, content } });
  revalidatePath('/'); // Critical: page revalidation for immediate updates
}
```
