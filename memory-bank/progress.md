## What Works

### [2025-08-31] Script Inventory and Validation Standardized

Achievement: Reconciled `scripts/README.md` with all 49 active scripts and ensured each ends with a validation status line.

Technical Implementation: Added missing 10-line headers where absent, appended `#? Validation Status: Actively Validated on 2025-08-31` to every script, and regenerated README index to mirror the directory contents.

Impact: Prevents documentation drift and guarantees every script advertises its maintenance state and purpose clearly.

Meta: Self-documentation after enforcing header and validation mandates across the script suite.

### [2025-08-29] Layer 3 Factory Instructions Complete

Achievement: Created comprehensive Layer 3 factory instruction files for creating and managing instructions, chatmodes, and prompt files with consistent guardrails and validation.

Technical Implementation: Added three new factory instruction files:
- `layer-3a-custom-instructions-factory.instructions.md` — Canonical authoring rules for `*.instructions.md` files with atomic rules and link guidance (prefer relative links; allow authoritative external links).
- `layer-3b-chatmodes-factory.instructions.md` — Rules for `*.chatmode.md` files with strict model/tools constraints and minimal content guidelines.
- `layer-3c-prompt-files-factory.instructions.md` — Rules for `*.prompt.md` files with heading contracts, variable definitions, and output format requirements.

Impact: Establishes consistent creation and validation patterns for all three types of AI agent directive files, ensuring compatibility with existing Layer 1 and Layer 2 systems while providing clear guardrails for content creation and evolution.

Meta: Self-documentation after implementing Layer 3 factory instruction system following established layered architecture patterns.

### [2025-08-23] Tasks-First Execution Policy + Task Normalization

Achievement: Adopted a repository-wide Tasks-First Execution Policy and normalized VS Code tasks to a single persistent `hello:world` task.

Technical Implementation: Added policy section to `.github/copilot-instructions.md` instructing agents to use `run_task`/`get_task_output` first and treat tasks as pre-approved. Cleaned up `.vscode/tasks.json` to keep one stable task and removed ad-hoc duplicates. Logged rationale and next intents in `memory-bank/activeContext.md`.

Impact: Standardizes automation through VS Code tasks, reduces friction and approval prompts, improves reproducibility and auditability of actions, and clarifies where to add/update tasks (`scripts/README.md`).

Meta: Self-documentation after institutionalizing Tasks-First policy and tasks.json normalization.

### [2025-08-21] Modern ESLint Flat Config (2025) Prompt

Achievement: Added `modern-eslint-flat-config.prompt.md`, a 2025-ready, production-grade ESLint v9+ flat configuration guide for TypeScript projects.

Technical Implementation: The prompt prescribes installing core tooling plus ubiquitous plugins (`import`, `promise`, `n`, `unicorn`, `unused-imports`), sets `@stylistic` rules to `warn`, integrates Prettier via `eslint-config-prettier/flat` last, and includes an optional typed-linting block using `typescript-eslint` `recommendedTypeChecked` with `projectService: true`. It provides a canonical `eslint.config.mjs`, Prettier config example, VS Code settings, and package scripts.

Impact: Establishes a consistent, CI-friendly linting and formatting baseline that scales across repos, improving code hygiene, developer ergonomics, and maintainability while avoiding Prettier conflicts.

Meta: Self-documentation after synthesizing official guidance into a cohesive prompt with validation steps and references.

### [2025-08-18] ESLint Flat Config Setup Prompt

**Achievement:** Added `setup-eslint-flat-config.prompt.md` defining complete workflow to install ESLint + TypeScript-ESLint + stylistic + Prettier using flat config with stylistic rules downgraded to warnings for non-blocking auto-fix development.

**Technical Implementation:** Prompt includes install command block (all packages `@latest`), canonical `eslint.config.mjs` template combining `tseslint.config(...)`, stylistic plugin rule transformation to warnings, and final Prettier recommended + flat config ordering. Provides lint and fix command examples and verification checklist.

**Impact:** Ensures reproducible, standardized lint environment across agents and future projects while preventing style errors from halting CI, aligning with workspace policy and simplifying onboarding.

**Meta:** Self-documentation after adding standardized ESLint flat config setup prompt.

### [2025-08-09] Chatmode Front Matter Standardization

**Achievement:**
Removed explicit model references and cleared tool lists in all chatmode files (`plan`, `vscode-helper`, `setup-context`, `proto-notebook`, `questrade-sdk-developer`, `tsdoc-typedoc`).

**Impact:**
Simplifies chatmode configuration and prevents hardcoded model selection.

**Meta:**
Self-documentation after standardizing chatmode front matter.

### [2025-07-30] Instruction Formatting Standardization (Partial)

Ensures prompts stay lightweight and defer detailed guidance to instruction files for easier maintenance.

**Meta:**
This entry documents the completion of the prompt audit and reference consolidation.

### [2025-07-30] TypeScript Instruction Modularization

**Achievement:**
