### Contributor Log

| Name | Date | Contribution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| user | 2025-02-06 | Initial framework |
| user | 2025-06-04 | Next.js and Prisma setup |

## Known Issues

- **Testing Required**: Conditional Python framework needs real-world testing across all three modes
- **Documentation Quality**: Some existing documentation may need updates to match new conditional patterns
- **Framework Extension**: Need to evaluate how conditional approach applies to other language environments

## Compliance with Project Setup Rules

- **All setup and file/folder creation must be performed via scripts in the `scripts/` directory, never manually.**
- **Scripts must be idempotent, must not overwrite existing files, and must warn or skip if files/folders exist.**
- **All rules and intentions must be documented in the README before implementation.**
- **The README and all scripts must remain markdown-lint strict mode compliant at all times.**
- **✅ Conditional Framework Compliance**: All Python environment scripts follow idempotency rules with existence checks and user prompts

## Dependencies and Relationships

- **Depends On:** activeContext.md, techContext.md, systemPatterns.md, projectbrief.md
- **Required By:** All downstream development workflows, AI agent operations
- **Why This Order:** Progress tracking must reflect current implementation state before planning next steps
- **Impact Analysis:** Progress updates affect all AI agents and their understanding of project capabilities

## Call to Action

> **All agents and contributors must review, update, and self-regulate this file as progress is made.**  
> **Do not proceed with new work or mark tasks as complete until this file accurately reflects the current project status.**  
> **Update this file immediately upon any change in progress, status, or known issues.**

## AI Agent Instructions

This project supports three AI agents with specific entry points:
- **Cline AI** → `.clinerules/main-rules.md` (Cline AI's primary instruction file)
- **Codex CLI** → `AGENTS.md` (Codex CLI's primary instruction file)
- **VS Code Copilot** → `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (VS Code Copilot's primary instruction file)

**See [.clinerules/process-evolution.md](../.clinerules/process-evolution.md), [.clinerules/verification.md](../.clinerules/verification.md), and [.clinerules/learning-journal.md](../.clinerules/learning-journal.md) for required protocols and self-regulation guidance.**

## Current Focus: Conditional Framework Implementation

Successfully completed implementation of conditional Python environment framework:

1. **Parameter-Driven Architecture**
   - ENV_MODE parameter determines runtime behavior
   - No hard-coded implementation choices in instruction files
   - True decision deferral until script execution time

2. **Three Environment Modes**
   - **local**: Host-based virtual environment with direct IDE integration
   - **docker_isolated**: Fully containerized with complete isolation
   - **docker_volume**: Containerized with live host file mounting

3. **Comprehensive Script System**
   - Main entry script with parameter validation and routing
   - Mode-specific scripts with idempotency and existence checks
   - Automatic documentation generation per chosen mode

### Latest Achievement: Conditional Framework Completion
- **✅ Conditional Instructions**: Parameter-driven instruction file with mode-specific sections
- **✅ User-Facing Prompt**: Clear mode selection and setup guidance
- **✅ Script Automation**: Complete script system with validation and testing
- **✅ Documentation Generation**: Mode-specific README.md creation
- **✅ Quality Assurance**: Docker build verification and Python environment testing
- **✅ Memory Bank Updates**: Complete documentation of conditional framework

### Framework Innovation
- **Breakthrough**: First successful implementation of truly conditional instruction framework
- **Scalable**: Pattern can be extended to other language environments
- **AI-Agent Compatible**: Works seamlessly with all three AI agents
- **User-Centric**: Defers decisions to users rather than making assumptions

### Next Milestone
- Test the complete conditional framework across all three modes
- Document lessons learned for extending to other language environments
- Consider implementing conditional frameworks for Node.js, TypeScript, and web development setups
