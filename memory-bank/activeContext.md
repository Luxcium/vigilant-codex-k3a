### [2025-09-23] Early Development Policy — No Lock Files

Decision recorded to avoid committing package manager lock files during early development to maintain agility. Implemented `.gitignore` rules for all lockfile types and configured `.npmrc` with `save-lockfile=false` and `package-lock=false` to prevent generation. Existing `pnpm-lock.yaml` removed from version control. This aligns with the repository's Session‑Sticky Preferences.

### [2025-09-23] VS Code Tasks Configuration Fixed

Fixed malformed `tasks.json` containing duplicate JSON objects. Created unified task configuration with concurrent launch capabilities:

- Individual tasks: `web:activate-env`, `web:dev`, `web:lint`, `web:test`, `web:format`
- Background services: `Start Web Dev Server (bg)`, `Browser CDP Monitor (bg)`
- Compound task: `Dev: Web + CDP Monitor (bg)` for parallel execution
- Proper problem matchers and presentation settings for optimal UX

**Validation Results:**

- ✅ All VS Code JSON files pass error validation (`tasks.json`, `launch.json`, `extensions.json`)
- ✅ Simple Browser opened successfully at `http://localhost:3000`
- ✅ Compound launch configuration `Launch All: Web + Edge + CDP` ready for concurrent execution
- ✅ Extension recommendations include Edge DevTools for proper instrumentation tracks the current work focus, recent changes, next steps, and active decisions for the Vigilant Codex K3a polyvalent AI development workspace.

## Current Focus Snapshot

### [2025-12-07] Progress Remediation Complete — Restore Automation Guardrails

**Current State:** `memory-bank/progress.md` rebuilt with verified counts, encoding fixed, and prior narrative archived.

**Last Action:** Added `memory-bank/instructions/progress-maintenance.instructions.md` to enforce count verification, archiving discipline, and self-healing updates.

**Rationale:** Restores trust in status documentation before tackling automation gaps flagged by the Memory Bank assessment.

**Next Intent:** Rebuild CI and documentation automation per the refreshed `What’s Left` section in `progress.md`, beginning with GitHub Actions reinstatement and script consolidation review.

---

### [2025-12-06] Memory Bank Critical Assessment Follow-up - URGENT Priority

**Current State:** Comprehensive Memory Bank assessment completed revealing CRITICAL integrity issues requiring immediate remediation. Assessment documented in [memory-bank-assessment-2025-12-06.md](./memory-bank-assessment-2025-12-06.md).

**Last Action:** Completed systematic evaluation of all 9 core Memory Bank and agent instruction files. **CRITICAL FINDINGS**: progress.md has severe encoding corruption (mojibake sequences), 4+ months staleness, and script count discrepancies (documented 22-23 vs actual 59 scripts).

**Rationale:** Assessment identified MEDIUM-HIGH risk level due to progress.md integrity crisis threatening Memory Bank reliability. Immediate action required to prevent further degradation and restore system integrity.

**Next Intent:** Execute immediate remediation actions per assessment recommendations - reconstruct progress.md content, reconcile script inventory documentation, implement staleness detection.

**Status Update (2025-12-07):** Remediation completed; see preceding entry for follow-on priorities.
