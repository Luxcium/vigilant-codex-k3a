## Current Focus Snapshot

### [2025-12-06] Memory Bank Grooming Implementation - CRITICAL Priority

**Current State:** Implementing systematic Memory Bank optimization following comprehensive analysis. Multiple grooming tasks completed with critical script consolidation discrepancy discovered.

**Last Action:** Fixed techContext.md build output segregation rules. **DISCOVERED CRITICAL ISSUE**: AUDIT.sync.md findings confirmed - scripts/README.md claims consolidation (41→22→23 scripts) but actual count is 59 scripts. Documentation severely out of sync with reality.

**Rationale:** Memory Bank grooming essential for AI agent session startup speed and context accuracy. Script consolidation discrepancy represents major documentation integrity issue requiring immediate resolution.

**Next Intent:** Address script consolidation documentation discrepancy, archive historical systemPatterns.md content, then complete remaining compliance sections for core files.

## Recent Changes (Last 30 Days)

### [2025-09-04] Script Sandbox Wrappers Implementation

**Achievement:** Added `scripts/sandbox_docker_run.sh` and `scripts/sandbox_run.sh` to enable no-side-effect script validation with mocks and read-only repo mounts.

- Updated `scripts/analyze-test-structure.sh` for dynamic `PROJECT_ROOT` resolution
- Documented sandbox usage in `scripts/README.md`
- Added AI agent guidance comments to relevant scripts
- Created `memory-bank/instructions/script-sandbox.instructions.md`

**Impact:** Safe, repeatable validation of scripts without network access or repository writes

### [2025-08-31] Prompt Management Consolidation

**Achievement:** Eliminated redundant prompt-management files and established minimal, clearly scoped template set.

- Deleted overlapping files: `ai-template-manager.prompt.md`, `make-prompts.prompt.md`, `prompt-files.prompt.md`
- Enhanced `template-manager.prompt.md` with scope determination and naming standards
- Rewritten `define-prompt-file.prompt.md` with README sync guidance

**Impact:** Clear prompt workflow with maintained README synchronization

### [2025-08-31] README Consolidation Emergency Resolution

**Achievement:** Resolved urgent workspace conflicts from README duplication across 12 locations.

- Systematic removal of duplicate README variants (sync, synced, rewrite, final, consolidated)
- Created single authoritative README.md per directory
- Established `memory-bank/README.md` as consolidated reference
- Implemented safeguard script verification

**Impact:** Eliminated workspace documentation conflicts and established clear documentation hierarchy

### [2025-08-31] Remote Actors RPC System Baseline

**Achievement:** Implemented minimal RPC system foundation under `src/remote-actors` and `src/rpc`.

- Worker-thread pool with JSON protocol implementation
- HTTP/TCP transports with configuration management
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Complete documentation and dependency tracking

**Impact:** Extensible foundation for remote actor architecture with future expansion capability

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (Next 24 hours)

1. **Complete Memory Bank Grooming** - Continue systematic optimization:
   - ✅ Diagram redundancy elimination (COMPLETED)
   - 🔄 activeContext.md rolling archive (IN PROGRESS)
   - ⏳ Consolidate dependencies.md duplicate sections
   - ⏳ Add traceability matrix to progress.md
   - ⏳ Standardize Session-Sticky Preferences across agents

2. **Validate Grooming Impact** - Measure session startup improvement and context accuracy

### Short-term Goals (Next Week)

1. **Baseline Timestamp Implementation** - Add drift detection timestamps to all core files
2. **Compliance Section Addition** - Add "Dependencies and Relationships" to remaining core files  
3. **AUDIT.sync.md Resolution** - Address script consolidation discrepancies
4. **Build Output Segregation** - Fix techContext.md missing build rules

### Medium-term Objectives (Next Month)

1. **Production Deployment Enhancement** - Next.js application optimization and advanced features
2. **Multi-Agent Framework Validation** - Real-world testing across conditional Python environment modes
3. **Performance Testing Suite** - Comprehensive benchmarks for SDK components
4. **Integration Testing Coverage** - End-to-end workflow validation

## Active Decisions

### Memory Bank Grooming Implementation ⚡ **CRITICAL**

**Decision:** Systematic Memory Bank optimization for speed and accuracy improvement
**Implementation:** Rolling archive system with signal-to-noise optimization
**Rationale:** AI agent session startup speed directly impacts development velocity
**Status:** **IN PROGRESS** - Rolling archive implementation active

### Diagram Redundancy Elimination ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Decision:** Single authoritative Memory Bank flowchart in systemPatterns.md
**Implementation:** Replaced 6+ redundant diagrams with references to authoritative source
**Rationale:** Eliminated 6x parsing overhead and reduced Memory Bank ingestion time
**Status:** **COMPLETED** - All redundant diagrams successfully eliminated

### Session-Sticky Preferences Standardization

**Decision:** Unified preference management across all three AI agents
**Implementation:** Consistent Session-Sticky Preferences sections in instruction files
**Rationale:** Ensures behavioral consistency and reduces agent coordination friction  
**Status:** **PLANNED** - Implementation after current grooming priorities

### Historical Content Preservation Strategy

**Decision:** 30-day rolling archive with complete historical preservation
**Implementation:** Chronological archival in archives/ directory with searchable organization
**Rationale:** Optimizes current context while maintaining complete audit trail
**Status:** **IMPLEMENTING** - Rolling archive system development

## Historical Context Archive

### Complete Historical Records

All comprehensive historical context entries from 2025-07-12 through 2025-09-04 have been preserved in:

- **[activeContext-archive-2025-07-12-2025-09-04.md](./archives/activeContext-archive-2025-07-12-2025-09-04.md)** - Complete historical entries including:
  - Layer 4 automation implementation
  - Script consolidation from 41→22→23 scripts  
  - Tasks-First Policy adoption for VS Code
  - Prompt metadata standardization
  - ESLint flat config implementation
  - CI workflow optimization and local validation
  - Documentation refactor and migration

## Dependencies and Relationships

- **Depends On:** [projectbrief.md](./projectbrief.md), [systemPatterns.md](./systemPatterns.md), [techContext.md](./techContext.md)
- **Required By:** [progress.md](./progress.md), [dependencies.md](./dependencies.md), all AI agent operations
- **Impact Analysis:** Active context changes immediately affect all AI agents' understanding of current priorities and development focus
- **Rolling Archive Trigger:** Entries older than 30 days automatically archived to maintain optimal signal-to-noise ratio
- **Cross-Agent Synchronization:** Updates propagated to Session-Sticky Preferences across Cline AI, Codex CLI, and VS Code Copilot

## Call to Action

> **All agents must review, update, and self-regulate this file as work progresses.**  
> **Do not proceed with new work until this file accurately reflects current state and priorities.**  
> **Update immediately upon any change in work focus, plans, or decisions.**  
> **Maintain 30-day rolling archive to prevent signal degradation.**  
> **Ensure strict markdown-lint compliance and proper cross-referencing.**

### AI Agent Instructions

This project supports three AI agents with specific entry points:

- **Cline AI** → [`.clinerules/main-rules.md`](../.clinerules/main-rules.md)
- **Codex CLI** → [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md)  
- **VS Code Copilot** → [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](../.github/copilot-instructions.md)

**All agents must prioritize current focus snapshot and maintain active context accuracy for effective collaboration.**
