## Current Work Focus

### [2025-07-23T16:30:00Z] Script Consolidation Implementation Plan Complete

**Current State:**
Created comprehensive plan to consolidate 41 scripts into 15 purpose-driven, well-documented scripts. Plan reduces redundancy by 63% while maintaining all functionality through parameter-driven interfaces.

**Last Action:**
Analyzed all 41 scripts in `/scripts` directory, identified redundancy patterns, and created detailed implementation plan in `SCRIPT_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md`.

**Rationale:**
User requested resolution of script proliferation and documentation gaps. Current 41 scripts have significant overlap, inconsistent documentation, and confusing reference patterns in `.vscode/tasks.json`.

**Next Intent:**
Execute the consolidation plan in 4 phases: Environment Setup → Functional Groups → Documentation Updates → Testing & Validation.

**I am executing the Self-Documentation Protocol after completing script consolidation planning.**

### [2025-07-22T23:10:00Z] Root Context Inventory & Script Protocol Implementation

**Current State:**
Root context directories fully documented in `README.md` and `projectbrief.md`.
Introduced script documentation protocol in `systemPatterns.md` and `.clinerules`.

**Next Intent:**
- Ensure all shell scripts contain header comments and are listed in `scripts/README.md`.
- Consolidate any duplicate scripts.

### [2025-07-22T22:44:00Z] Development Session Analysis Complete - Ready for Instructions

**Current State:**
Completed comprehensive project analysis and environment topology assessment. Project structure and memory bank system fully understood. Ready to proceed with development tasks per user instructions.

## Implementation Note (2025-07-19T18:30:00Z)

**Decision/Note:**
We have decided to implement, in a future update, a reference-based port allocation pattern for the 5000-range (BASE_PORT=5000) using the same static index methodology as the 3000-range. The service at index 0 (e.g., monitoring dashboard or main web frontend) will use ports 5000–5009, with retries incrementing within this block. This will ensure consistent, predictable port mapping for monitoring and production dashboards, following the same robust, stateful allocation logic as in the 3000-range.

**Rationale:**
This approach maintains architectural consistency, simplifies service discovery, and supports robust, conflict-free port allocation for all major service groups (development, monitoring, production, etc.).

**Next Intent:**
Implement this pattern in the codex_run.sh and related orchestration scripts when expanding monitoring/production service support.

**Meta:**
I am recording this as part of the Self-Documentation Protocol. This entry reaffirms that all actions and context changes MUST be documented and that this rule itself is part of the ongoing protocol.

## Implementation Note (2025-07-23T01:40:00Z)

**Decision/Note:**
Established a formal root context classification and script documentation protocol.
Created `memory-bank/root-contexts.md`, updated `README.md`, `.clinerules/main-rules.md`, and `scripts/README.md` accordingly.

**Rationale:**
Clarifies folder purposes for all agents and enforces autonomous maintenance of script documentation.

**Next Intent:**
Ensure future scripts include purpose comments and that the root context list remains current.

**Meta:**
Self-Documentation Protocol executed after establishing folder classification and script maintenance rules.

## Active Decisions

### Memory Bank Structure Standardization ⚡ **CRITICAL**

**Decision**: Mandatory compliance with official Cline Memory Bank structure for all files
**Implementation**: Systematic transformation with historical archival and zero information loss
**Rationale**: Essential for AI agent functionality, faster session startup, and professional documentation standards
**Status**: **IN PROGRESS** - Actively implementing across all memory bank files

### Official Formatting Requirements Enforcement

**Decision**: Strict markdown-lint compliance with single # header rule and proper hierarchy
**Implementation**: Updated `.clinerules/main-rules.md` with mandatory formatting standards
**Rationale**: Ensures GitHub integration, tool compatibility, and consistent documentation quality
**Status**: **ACTIVE** - Enforcing in all current and future memory bank updates

### Historical Content Preservation Strategy

**Decision**: Complete historical record preservation through archives/ directory structure
**Implementation**: Chronological archival with proper cross-referencing and searchable organization
**Rationale**: Maintains complete audit trail while optimizing current context for AI agents
**Status**: **IMPLEMENTING** - Archives created with comprehensive historical preservation

### AI Agent Optimization Priority

**Decision**: Current context optimization takes precedence over feature development
**Implementation**: Focus on memory bank efficiency before expanding functionality
**Rationale**: Foundation must be solid for effective AI agent collaboration and development velocity
**Status**: **ACTIVE** - Memory bank optimization in progress

## Historical Context Archive

Complete historical context records are preserved in:

- **[activeContext-archive-2025-06-2025-07.md](./archives/activeContext-archive-2025-06-2025-07.md)** - Detailed historical entries from June-July 2025

This archive contains comprehensive historical context including Next.js v15+ implementation details, native fetch conversion process, test suite optimization, Edge DevTools integration, README drift resolution, GitHub MCP server integration, and complete development workflow evolution.

## Dependencies and Relationships

- **Depends On:** [projectbrief.md](./projectbrief.md), [systemPatterns.md](./systemPatterns.md), [techContext.md](./techContext.md)
- **Required By:** [progress.md](./progress.md), [dependencies.md](./dependencies.md), all AI agent operations, development workflows
- **Why This Order:** Active context must reflect current implementation state from foundational documents before tracking progress
- **Impact Analysis:** Changes to active context immediately affect all AI agents' understanding of current priorities, development focus, and resource allocation decisions

## Call to Action

> **All agents and contributors must review, update, and self-regulate this file as work progresses.**  
> **Do not proceed with new work or changes until this file accurately reflects the current state and priorities.**  
> **Update this file immediately upon any change in work focus, plans, or decisions.**  
> **Maintain strict markdown-lint compliance and proper cross-referencing at all times.**

## AI Agent Instructions

This project supports three AI agents with specific entry points:

- **Cline AI** → [`.clinerules/main-rules.md`](../.clinerules/main-rules.md) (Cline AI's primary instruction file)
- **Codex CLI** → [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) (Codex CLI's primary instruction file)
- **VS Code Copilot** → [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](../.github/copilot-instructions.md) (VS Code Copilot's primary instruction file)

**All agents must prioritize Memory Bank optimization and maintain active context accuracy for effective collaboration.**
