# Recursive Output-Verified Playground Workflow

## Canonical Procedure for Agent Sessions

1. Build and run the current playground (e.g., `src/example.ts`).
2. Verify output in `.keys/example-sdk-demo.json` for correctness and completeness.
3. Log the demonstration and output verification in the memory bank.
4. For each code iteration, repeat steps 1â€“3, ensuring robust, reproducible, and agentic development.
5. Reference this workflow in all chatmode/instructions for future agent sessions.

**Purpose:**
This recursive, output-verified workflow ensures every code change is validated by real output and that the process is remembered and referenced by all agents and chatmodes.
