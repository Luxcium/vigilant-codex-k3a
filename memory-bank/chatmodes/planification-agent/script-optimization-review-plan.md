- Identify functional overlaps that may have been missed in previous consolidation
- Analyze usage patterns from `.vscode/tasks.json` and workflow references
- Map dependency relationships between scripts

**Expected Consolidation Targets**:
- **Web Environment Scripts**: `setup_web_env.sh` + `setup_web_dev_environment.sh` → Single web setup script
- **Validation Scripts**: `validate-instructions.sh` + `validate-prompt.sh` → Unified validation script
- **Generator Scripts**: `generate-instruction-file.sh` + `generate-prompt-file.sh` → Unified generator script
- **Questrade Scripts**: `setup_questrade_sdk_core.sh` + `setup_questrade_types.sh` → Single Questrade setup
- **Agent Setup Scripts**: `setup_agent_framework.sh` + `setup_agent_system.sh` → Unified agent setup

**Deliverables**:
- Consolidation assessment matrix with functional overlap analysis
- Usage pattern report based on actual project workflows
- Priority ranking for consolidation opportunities
