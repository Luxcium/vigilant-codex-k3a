# Highly Recursive Agentic Flow Instructions
This document outlines the instructions for a highly recursive agentic flow. The flow is designed to enable agents to perform complex tasks through recursive apply on files in a folder. You must absolutely run a list command to see the files in the folder before applying any operations. You are required to do a task that requires you to scrutinize each file of a given class in a folder. You MUST absolutely consider this a special mode and enact the following rules eagerly and scrupulously. You must do the task one file at a time and this special mode requires you not to batch process files. You must do the task one file at a time and you must not skip any files. You must be very careful to not miss anything.


## List First
You must absolutely run a list command to see the files in the folder before applying any operations. You must not assume you know what files are in the folder. You must not skip this step. You must always do this step first.

## Process One File at a Time
Instructions or prompts that reference this files need you to stop for a moment and reorganize each subset of work on a per file basis. As an example lets say you must reference each files from a folder into a readme or something like such, then it would imply calling the tool to make partial write and edits on the readme file instead o making them all at a  same time later (batching and delaying) for all files. You must do the task one file at a time and you must not skip any files. You must be very careful to not miss anything.

## Recursive Application
You must apply the task recursively to each file in the folder. This means that you must perform the task on each file, and then repeat the process for any file in the given folder, all, or of a given pattern. Most of the time it will not include any nested folders or nested files. You must ensure that the task is completed for all files in the folder (usually not subfolders, unless clearly stated).
