# productContext.md

## Purpose
Defines the product motivation, user experience intent, and success criteria guiding all implementation decisions. Provides the WHY that the foundational brief (projectbrief.md) enables and that execution/state files (activeContext.md, progress.md) operationalize.

## Why This Project Exists
Vigilant Codex K3a addresses fragmentation and context loss in multi‑language, AI‑augmented software development. It establishes a persistent, polyvalent, script‑driven workspace where AI agents collaborate coherently, memory is durable, and quality emerges from enforced process rather than ad‑hoc effort.

Core Motivation (Condensed):
- Preserve context across AI sessions
- Coordinate complementary AI agents
- Avoid premature architectural lock‑in (conditional runtime decisions)
- Eliminate documentation drift via enforced Memory Bank protocol
- Unify TypeScript, Python, Next.js, Docker, and notebook workflows

(Full original narrative retained in archives/productContext-archive.md)

## Problems Being Solved (Summary)
| Problem | Impact | Solution Vector |
| ------- | ------ | --------------- |
| Session context loss | Repeated re-explanation | Mandatory Memory Bank read protocol |
| Uncoordinated AI tools | Divergent decisions / duplication | Three-agent role delineation |
| Hard-coded environment choices | Rigidity & rework | Parameterized conditional framework |
| Documentation-code divergence | Misinformed decisions | Self‑documentation & archival discipline |
| Multi-language friction | Toolchain overhead | Polyvalent unified scripts & patterns |
| Quality enforcement burden | Manual inconsistency | Scripted validation + coverage targets |

---

## How It Should Work
Principles:
- Seamless session resumption (context already loaded)
- Runtime-selectable environment modes without structural churn
- AI agents provide role-scoped, non-overlapping assistance
- Documentation updated in lockstep with architectural or state changes
- Testing and linting act as gates, not afterthoughts
- Archives retain historical depth; active files stay concise

---

## User Experience Goals
Developer Experience:
- Onboarding to productivity: hours, not days
- Immediate retrieval of architectural intent
- Minimal cognitive switching across languages
- Confidence in standards & test rigor by default

Team & Stakeholder Experience:
- Transparent progress (progress.md + activeContext.md)
- Stable architectural intent (systemPatterns.md references)
- Traceability from feature decisions back to product rationale
- Low risk of knowledge loss during personnel or agent turnover

AI Agent Collaboration:
- Consistent interpretation of scope & intent
- Fast convergence on relevant suggestions
- No duplication of long-form rationale across active files

---

## Success Metrics (Operational Targets)
| Category | Metric | Target |
| -------- | ------ | ------ |
| Context Persistence | Fresh session readiness (all core files ingested) | < 30s |
| Quality | Branch coverage | ≥ 98% |
| Documentation Freshness | Update latency after major change | < 24h |
| Environment Setup | Full developer environment | < 5 min |
| Developer Flow | Resume task after return | < 2 min |
| Stability | Regressions during feature delivery | Zero unintended |
| AI Efficiency | Relevant answer turnaround | < 10s |
| Flexibility | Change environment mode w/out restructure | Always supported |

Strategic Health Signals:
- Memory Bank synchronization maintained
- No conflicting agent edits
- Archive growth corresponds to reduced active verbosity
- Successful multi-language integration w/out drift

---

## Dependencies and Relationships
- **Depends On:** projectbrief.md (foundational scope & requirements)
- **Informs:** activeContext.md (current focus), progress.md (status), systemPatterns.md (architectural alignment), techContext.md (tooling expectations)
- **Archive Reference:** Full pre-refactor narrative in archives/productContext-archive.md
- **Impact Analysis:** Misalignment here cascades into mis-prioritized implementation, degraded AI suggestion quality, and diluted architectural coherence.

---

## Call to Action
> Keep this file minimal and intent-driven. On major rationale changes: update summary here, move superseded detail into the archive, propagate impacts to dependent Memory Bank files, and ensure metrics remain actionable.
