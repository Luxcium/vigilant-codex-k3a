# Python Directory

This directory contains all Python source code, modules, and environment configuration for the project.

## Purpose
- Store all Python application and library code.
- Maintain environment setup files (requirements.txt, .env, Dockerfile).
- Support both local and Docker-based development workflows.

## Structure
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies
- `.env` — Environment variables (do not commit secrets)
- `Dockerfile` — Container build for Python environment
- `README.md` — Setup and usage instructions

See [python-environment.instructions.md](../.github/instructions/python-environment.instructions.md) for full environment standards.
