# Agent Framework

This folder contains a TypeScript-based multi-agent retrieval system. Run `scripts/setup_agent_framework.sh` to regenerate the initial project structure.

Use `pnpm` to build and test once dependencies are installed. This workspace is pnpm-only; do not use npm or yarn. Lockfiles are intentionally not used.
