# Generate Instructions File

Your goal is to create a properly structured `.instructions.md` file based on the user's requirements for coding standards, guidelines, or project rules.

## Context

- Target file: `${input:filename:Enter instruction file name (e.g., typescript-style)}.instructions.md`
- Scope: `${input:scope:Describe what code this should apply to (e.g., "all TypeScript files", "React components")}`
- Standards type: `${input:standardsType:What type of standards? (coding style, architecture, security, testing, etc.)}`

## Requirements

### File Structure Standards

- Include proper front matter with applyTo pattern
- Use single H1 title describing the standards
- Organize content with H2 for major categories
- Use H3 for subcategories when needed
- Format rules as bullet points with imperative language

### ApplyTo Pattern Selection

- Use `"**"` for global project rules
- Use `"**/*.{ext}"` for language-specific rules
- Use `"**/folder/**"` for directory-specific rules
- Use `"**/*.{test,spec}.*"` for testing-specific rules

### Content Quality Requirements

- Write rules as imperative statements using action verbs
- Begin rules with "Use", "Implement", "Ensure", "Apply", "Follow"
- Be specific and actionable in every rule statement
- Avoid vague terms like "appropriate", "good", "proper"
- Include code examples in fenced blocks when beneficial

## Process

1. **Analyze User Requirements**
   - Determine the scope of standards needed
   - Identify the target file types or directories
   - Categorize the type of standards (style, architecture, security, etc.)

2. **Create Front Matter**
   - Generate appropriate applyTo glob pattern based on scope
   - Use YAML format with proper syntax

3. **Structure Content by Standards Type**

   **For Coding Style Standards:**
   ```markdown
   ## Style Guidelines
   - [Specific style rules]
   
   ## Naming Conventions
   - [Naming rules]
   
   ## Code Organization
   - [Import and structure rules]
   ```

   **For Architectural Patterns:**
   ```markdown
   ## Component Structure
   - [Organization rules]
   
   ## File Organization
   - [Directory and naming rules]
   
   ## Design Patterns
   - [Pattern implementation rules]
   ```

   **For Security Practices:**
   ```markdown
   ## Input Validation
   - [Validation rules]
   
   ## Authentication
   - [Auth implementation rules]
   
   ## Data Protection
   - [Security requirement rules]
   ```

4. **Write Specific Rules**
   - Formulate each rule as an imperative statement
   - Include examples for complex or ambiguous rules
   - Specify exceptions explicitly when they exist
   - Cross-reference related instruction files when appropriate

5. **Validate Content**
   - Ensure all rules are actionable and measurable
   - Check for conflicts with existing standards
   - Verify proper markdown formatting
   - Confirm heading hierarchy is correct

## Content Templates

### Global Standards Template
```markdown
---
applyTo: "**"
---

# ${standardsType} Standards

## General Principles
- [Universal rule 1]
- [Universal rule 2]

## Implementation Guidelines
- [Specific implementation rule]
- [Another implementation rule]

## Quality Requirements
- [Quality standard 1]
- [Quality standard 2]
```

### Language-Specific Template
```markdown
---
applyTo: "**/*.{ext}"
---

# ${language} ${standardsType} Standards

## Syntax Preferences
- [Language-specific syntax rule]
- [Another syntax rule]

## Best Practices
- [Framework-specific pattern]
- [Performance optimization rule]

## Anti-patterns to Avoid
- Never [bad practice]
- Avoid [problematic pattern]
```

### Domain-Specific Template
```markdown
---
applyTo: "**/domain/**"
---

# ${domain} ${standardsType} Guidelines

## Domain Rules
- [Business logic constraint]
- [Domain-specific requirement]

## Technical Implementation
- Use [pattern] for [purpose]
- Implement [feature] using [approach]

## Validation Requirements
- [Domain validation rule]
- [Data integrity rule]
```

## Variable Usage Guidelines

- Use descriptive variable names in examples: `${componentName}`, `${apiEndpoint}`
- Include placeholder text for complex concepts
- Reference file paths using `${workspaceFolder}` when appropriate
- Use input variables for user-specific values

## Quality Assurance Checklist

- [ ] ApplyTo pattern matches intended scope accurately
- [ ] All rules use imperative language consistently
- [ ] Examples are provided for complex rules
- [ ] No conflicting instructions exist
- [ ] Markdown formatting follows lint standards
- [ ] Content organization is logical and scannable
- [ ] Cross-references are accurate and helpful

## Success Criteria

### File Structure Validation
- Front matter includes proper applyTo pattern
- Content follows hierarchical organization
- All headings use appropriate levels
- Code blocks include language specifications

### Content Quality Validation
- Every rule is actionable and specific
- Language is consistently imperative
- Examples support rule clarity
- No vague or subjective terms used

### Scope Alignment Validation
- ApplyTo pattern matches user requirements
- Content depth appropriate for scope
- Rules are enforceable within specified context
- Integration with existing standards is clear

## Error Prevention

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Never create task execution lists (use prompts instead)
- Never use vague or subjective language
- Never create rules that conflict with language/framework defaults
- Never over-constrain without clear benefit
- Never omit the applyTo front matter pattern

### Quality Assurance Standards
- Always verify rules can be applied consistently
- Ensure AI agents can interpret and follow each rule
- Confirm rules improve code quality measurably
- Validate that rules are enforceable programmatically
- Check that rules align with modern best practices
