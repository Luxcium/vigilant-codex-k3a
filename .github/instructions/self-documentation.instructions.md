# Self-Documentation Protocol

## Trigger Recognition

- Upon any significant action or context change, run the Self-Documentation Protocol.
- Recognize these triggers:
  - New file or code generation
  - Script or prompt execution
  - Memory Bank update (activeContext.md, progress.md)
  - Agent initialization or session start

## State Logging Recipe

- Record a timestamped entry with:
  1. **Current State:** Key context values or file names.
  2. **Last Action:** Description of the change or operation.
  3. **Rationale:** Why this action occurred.
  4. **Next Intent:** Planned next step and purpose.

## Meta-Description

- In each log entry, include a note that you are executing the Self-Documentation Protocol.
- Example phrasing:  
  “I am updating my self-documentation after completing [X]. I include this log following the Self-Documentation Protocol.”

## Loop Reinforcement

- End every entry by restating the Self-Documentation requirement:
  - “This entry reaffirms that all actions and context changes must be documented and that this rule itself is part of the ongoing protocol.”

## Examples

```markdown
- [2025-05-26T16:59:00Z] Current State: generated prompt-manager; 
  Last Action: created ai-template-manager.prompt.md; 
  Rationale: scaffold prompt template; 
  Next Intent: update instruction patterns.
  Note: Executing Self-Documentation Protocol.
  This log reaffirms that self-documentation and meta-description are ongoing requirements.
```
