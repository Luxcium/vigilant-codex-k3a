# Learning Journal

## Pattern Recognition
- Memory Bank files are interconnected; changes must be propagated across files.
- Documentation must precede implementation.
- Script-driven changes ensure consistency and traceability.

## Process Evolution
1. Read ALL Memory Bank files first.
2. Plan changes across affected files.
3. Update documentation before implementation.
4. Use scripts for all changes.
5. Verify compliance and cross-references.

## Known Challenges
- Maintaining cross-file consistency.
- Ensuring complete documentation coverage.
- Following strict script-driven approach.
- Keeping all files markdown-lint compliant.

## Guidance
- Use this journal to log new patterns, challenges, and lessons learned.
- Reference this file in progress.md, activeContext.md, and all Memory Bank compliance sections.
