# Writing Protocol

## Update Triggers
- New patterns discovered
- System changes detected
- Process improvements identified
- Documentation gaps found

## Update Process
1. Update the relevant Memory Bank file first.
2. Cross-reference changes in other affected files.
3. Document rationale for changes in the appropriate rules file.
   - Reason: _why this change improves the project_
4. Verify markdown-lint compliance for all updated files.

## Guidance
