# Docs Directory Overview

This directory contains project documentation files such as guides, READMEs, and architecture notes.

Instruction files (`*.instructions.md`) and prompt files (`*.prompt.md`) are located under
`.github/instructions/` and `.github/prompts/` respectively and should not reside in this folder.

Always consult the relevant instruction or prompt file in `.github/` when working with coding
standards or agent workflows. This directory is for static reference documentation only.
